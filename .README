There's a foulder where you can find 3D model Objects to teste on /Objects
After running the program you can select option '1' to load a model.
  .I advise you to start with the small Models first, hand.obj, lamterna.obj, etc.
  .to select the object, you need to write Objects/example.obj.

This project was the final project of 'Programação Orientada a Objetos', 
  .after you 'upload' a model, the program will return faces, edges, and vertices
  .Them you can do other functions.
